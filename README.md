> Music Catalogue is a web-based catalogue management app built with **Django** and **MySQL**, developed as part of the **BCDE215 - Web Development** course at Ara Institute of Canterbury. It allows users to browse a collection of music albums and songs, while providing administrators with full CRUD control over the catalogue.
